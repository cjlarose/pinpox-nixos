**Configuration checks:** [![Build Status](https://drone.lounge.rocks/api/badges/pinpox/nixos/status.svg)](https://drone.lounge.rocks/pinpox/nixos)

This repository includes all configurations for my NixOS machines. Feel free to
use parts of it as you please, but keep it mind it is intended mostly for
personal use. I've written posts about certain aspects of this setup on my
[personal blog](https://pablo.tools/posts).

# Initial Setup

The structure of this repository is meant to allow easy manual deployment.
Individual hosts are defined in `/machines/<hostname>` and will import re-usable
parts of the configuration as needed.

Deployment is managed with [krops](https://tech.ingolf-wagner.de/nixos/krops/).
Secrets are stored in [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/).

**TL;DR** To use a host configuration on a fresh install, make sure that:

- The hostname is set correctly (`hostname <machine name>`)
- You are connected to the internet and have access rights to the repository
- Pass has the necessary secrets for the machine
- The machine's config is up-to-date

Then backup the generated `hardware-configuration.nix` file:

```bash
# Overwrite hardware-configuration.nix file with the generated one
cp /etc/nixos/hardware-configuration.nix \
   ./machines/$(hostname)/hardware-configuration.nix

# Commit and push the new file
git commit -am"Add hardware-configuration for $(hostname)" && git push
```

Finally, use `krops` to deploy the machine's configuration from a host that has
the secrets in it's store.

```bash
nix-build ./krops.nix -A <machine name> && ./result
```

It is also possible to build on the system itself when logged in, e.g. to get
additional debug information.

```bash
cd /var/src/machine-config
sudo nixos-rebuild --flake ".#kartoffel" switch
```

The services running on each host are documented in the host-specific
`README.md` files.

# Secrets TODO
TODO: link to sops-nix
TODO: secret repo structure and setup
user -> gpg
hosts -> age

TODO adding users/collaboraators
TODO adding hosts: Get public age key from new host

## Adding new hosts

### Get public host key

Get the public host key of the host. It will be used to encrypt secrets so that
the new host can decrypt them. Assuming the host is reachabe under
`new-host.tld` via SSH, use the following:

```bash
nix-shell -p ssh-to-age --run 'ssh-keyscan new-host.tld | ssh-to-age'

# ...

skipped key: got ssh-rsa key type, but only ed25519 keys are supported
age1XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

### Add key and path to `.sops.yaml`

Add the printed key (last line of previous output) and add to the `keys:`
section in `.sops.yaml`. Also add a new `creation_rule` referencing the added
key and the admin (`pinpox`) key for encryption.

```yaml
 keys:
   - &pinpox D03B218CAE771F77D7F920D9823A6154426408D3
   - &new-host age1XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
 creation_rules:
  - path_regex: hosts/new-host/[^/]+\.yaml$
    key_groups:
    - pgp:
      - *pinpox
      age:
      - *new-host
```

### Create secrets file

Create a new directory to hold all secret files for the host according to the
specified path and a `secrets.yaml` in it. At least, this file is assumend to be
present by the configuration.

```
mkdir hosts/new-host
nix-shell -p sops --run "sops hosts/new-host/secrets.yaml"
```

### Adding or editing secrets

TODO 
```
nix-shell -p sops --run "sops hosts/my-host/secrets.yaml"
```


# Deployment

## Default Deployment

Deployment is handled with [krops](https://tech.ingolf-wagner.de/nixos/krops/).
Every machine's deployment is defined in `krops.nix`. Additionally, there are
groups to deploy to multiple hosts at once.

To deploy to a single machine (e.g. `porree`):

```bash
nix-build ./krops.nix -A porree --show-trace && ./result
```

To deploy to a group (e.g. `servers`):

```bash
nix-build ./krops.nix -A all --show-trace && ./result
```

Ensure that the targets (`user@host` in krops.nix) are correct.


## First Deployment

If the system has not been configured to use flakes (e.g. fresh install), the
first deployment will have to be build on a machine that has. This can be done
from any of the other hosts that have the repository. The configuration will the
have the necessary options set, so that flakes works from now on with the normal
krops deployment.

```bash
# bash, zsh doesn't always work correctly
sudo nixos-rebuild --flake .#new-hostname --target-host new-host-ip> --build-host localhost switch
 ```

# Contributing?

While contributions don't make much sense for a personal configuration repository,
I'm always happy to get hints, tips and constructive criticism. If you find something 
that could be done in a better way, please let me know!
